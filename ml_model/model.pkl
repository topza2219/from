The file /borrow-system/ml_model/model.pkl is a binary file that contains the trained machine learning model. As such, it cannot be represented as text content. Typically, this file is generated by running a training script (like train_model.py) and is not manually created or edited.

If you need to create this file, you should run the appropriate training script that generates the model and saves it as model.pkl. 

For now, I will leave this file intentionally blank as it is not meant to contain human-readable content.
